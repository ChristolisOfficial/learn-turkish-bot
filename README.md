The Learn Turkish Bot is a Discord bot that was created for a server called Learn English and it primarily automates tasks during the April Fools day!

## Features
- Automatically translates text entries in a Discord server into a different language with the use of a specially-crafted text file!
- Backs up the original translations directly from the server in order to revert to them at any time the bot is instructed to do so!
- Swaps the original server icon with a fancy new one... maybe?

## Installation
To run the Discord from your own machine, you will need a version of the Java SDK 8+ or higher. Since the project makes use of Gradle, you will have to clone the project and execute `./gradlew build` inside its root folder.

## License
